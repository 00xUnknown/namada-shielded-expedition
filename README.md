# The Namada Shielded Expedition

Welcome to the Namada shielded expedition!

Here is where Namada pilots and crew members will expect to find the `balances.toml` file that allocates `NAAN` to public keys.

Using this `balances.toml` file, the included participants can generate and submit their **signed** pre-genesis *bonding* transactions in the `transactions` folder. These will be validated against, and only merged once the validation has passed.

Participants may bond ***up to*** the amount allocated to their public key. It is recommended not to bond the full allocation, as having `NAAN` to pay for gas will be useful. Any bonds greater than one's allocation will be rejected.
